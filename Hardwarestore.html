      This is a project completed using ASP.NET Razor Pages. I created this website for a hardware store that allows the employees to manage inventory, customers, and process sales. 
      It provides the ability to add new sale items to the list, update an existing item, delete items, add new customers, edit existing customer information, delete customers, and process sales.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   To accomplish this project, different web pages (Razor Pages) were created in ASP.NET and project requirements were accomplished accordingly. Client-side and Server-side validations
                    were implemented to prevent any threat to the sensitive information. For this project, database was designed in SQL Server Management Studio. Stored procedures were created to add a 
                    layer of security and prevent attacks like SQL Injection.
